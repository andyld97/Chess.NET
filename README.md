# Chess.NET

**Chess.NET** is a modern chess application game in **C# / .NET 10**, built completely from scratch.  
It includes (almost) full game rules, a WPF-based GUI, custom bot logic, and even the ability to **play against Stockfish** via UCI.

> ⚠️ **ATTENTION**  This game isn't finished yet and it's still very rudimental!
